# Weather_App

This app only requires the name of city and its country as user input and shows the temperature, weather conditions etc. of that place.
This app uses the openweather API to fetch the data for the required place.
Also I have used the Create-React-App boilerplate to by-pass the complications faced while configuring webpack and other packages, instead go straight to building it.
